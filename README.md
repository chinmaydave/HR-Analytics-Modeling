# Employee Job Change Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether employees are likely to change jobs using various classification algorithms and performance optimization techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data to predict job change likelihood, helping HR departments and recruiters make data-driven decisions about talent retention and recruitment strategies.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Size:** 19,000+ employee records
- **Features:** Employee demographics, education, experience, and training data
- **Target:** Binary classification (will change job: 0/1)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting framework
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing

## 🤖 Models Implemented

### 1. Logistic Regression
- Baseline linear model with feature scaling
- Fast training and interpretable results

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- Tree-based model with feature importance analysis
- Good for understanding decision paths

### 3. Random Forest Classifier
- Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
- Robust performance with feature importance ranking

### 4. Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Sequential ensemble method for improved accuracy
- Strong performance on structured data

### 5. AdaBoost Classifier
- Adaptive boosting algorithm
- Focuses on previously misclassified examples

### 6. XGBoost Classifier
- Optimized gradient boosting framework
- Industry-standard for tabular data competitions

### 7. Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)
- Deep learning approach with hidden layers (100, 50, 20 neurons)
- Captures complex non-linear relationships

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using comprehensive metrics:

- **Accuracy Score** - Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision** - True positive rate among predicted positives
- **Recall** - True positive rate among actual positives  
- **ROC-AUC Score** - Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Confusion Matrix** - Visual representation of prediction results
- **Feature Importance** - Understanding which features drive predictions

## 🏆 Results

- **Best Accuracy:** 85%+ achieved with ensemble methods
- **Top Performers:** Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers
- **Key Features:** Experience, education level, and training hours most predictive
